# Laravel Champlain

Welcome to the **Laravel Champlain** project! This repository contains various Laravel projects across multiple branches. Each branch corresponds to a separate Laravel project, and as we proceed through the course, we will work on different parts of each project using tags to track progress.

---
## Tag and Branch Structure
### 1. **Fetching All Branches and Tags**
After cloning the repository, you can fetch all the branches and tags at the beginning, or you can do it gradually as you build the project. Here is the command to fetch all branches and tags:
```sh
git fetch --all --tags
```
### 2. **Working with Tags**
Tags are labels attached to specific commits, allowing you to access them directly, regardless of the branch you're on. You can easily check out a tag from any branch.
For example, if you are on the `main` branch and want to check out the `00-task-list-init` tag, simply use the following command:
```sh
git checkout 00-task-list-init
```
### 3. **Checking Out Latest Code in a Branch**
To get the latest code from any branch, you can use the following command:
```sh
git checkout <your-branch-name>
```
### 4.  **Gradual Progress**: 
As you progress through the course, new tags will be added to reflect each stage of the project.
## Important Notice
> ### **`Be sure you start from the 00-init. This is the starting step in our learning path.`**
### Tag Naming Convention
The tags in this repository follow a specific naming convention:
```
digits-projectName-branchName-init or done
```
- **`digits`**: The number of stages within the project (can vary between projects and branches).
- **`projectName`**: The name of the specific project.
- **`branchName`**: The name of the branch where the project is being worked on.
- **`init`**: Refers to the beginning of the project (start of the learning path).
- **`done`**: Refers to the completed project.
### Example:
- If you check out the tag `00-task-list-init`, it means you're starting the task list project from scratch.
- If you check out the tag `task-list-done`, you will see the completed project code.
As the course progresses, tags will be added gradually as we move through the different concepts and stages.

## Project Progress

Since the project is being built gradually throughout the course, **you will not see all the tags unless we finish that chapter**. Each tag corresponds to a specific part of the project that is completed at the end of each course chapter.
